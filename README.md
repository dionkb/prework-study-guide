# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I need to build an easy to navigate webpage that allowed me to review the notes I took while completing the prework assignments. Building this project allowed me to both learn and apply techniques as they came up in the coursework. I now have a small study guide with information that will help remind me of things I have learned, so I can always go back to it to review anything I've forgotten or need to brush up on. Specifically, this web project covers the topics of: HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.

## Installation

## Usage

This webpage can be used to review notes on the four topics (HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript) that were covered in the prework. Bring up the ChromeDevTool console by clicking Ctrl+I, or right clicking the page and selecting "Inspect". On the newly opened dock, go to the "console" tab. You can use this simple function for suggestions on where to start first.
